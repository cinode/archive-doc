The security
############

Securty is the most important Cinode's factor. The lack of server side forces us
to use alternative methods to usual user authorisation. The approach that has
been used is based on cryptography.

Every blob in the Cinode network is stored and transferred to other nodes in an
encrypted form. The ability to decrypt this data (so hacing a decryption key) equals
a read access then.
