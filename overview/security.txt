The security
############

Securty is the most important Cinode's factor. The lack of server side forces us
to use alternative methods to usual user authorisation. The approach that has
been used is based on cryptography.

Every blob in the Cinode network is stored and transferred to other nodes in an
encrypted form. The ability to decrypt this data (so hacing a decryption key) equals
a read access then.

In addition, each blob reveals extra cryptographic properties simillar to
digital sognatures and cryptographic hashes. These properties are used
to validate blob and make sure hat it's content was created, modified
or simply agreed by authotized user. Simply put, it's equal write access
auhorization. The creator/modifier/acceptor of the blob must be in a
posession of all information needed to make the blob valid. A good example
of sich information is a private key used to sogn blob's content.

The blob vlidation process dos not require read access rights
(the encryption key). By doing so, nodes can safely exchange
blobs between them without reading acual blob content allowing
secure backups, load balancing and blob proxies.
