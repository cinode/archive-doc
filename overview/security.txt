The security
############

Security is the most important Cinode's factor. The lack of server side forces us
to use alternative methods to usual user authorization. The approach that has
been used is based on cryptography.

Every blob in the Cinode network is stored and transferred to other nodes in an
encrypted form. The ability to decrypt this data (so hacking a decryption key) equals
a read access then.

In addition, each blob reveals extra cryptographic properties similar to
digital signatures and cryptographic hashes. These properties are used
to validate blob and make sure hat it's content was created, modified
or simply agreed by authorized user. Simply put, it's equal write access
authorization. The creator/modifier/acceptor of the blob must be in a
possession of all information needed to make the blob valid. A good example
of such information is a private key used to sign blob's content.

The blob validation process does not require read access rights
(the encryption key). By doing so, nodes can safely exchange
blobs between them without reading actual blob content allowing
secure backups, load balancing and blob proxies.
