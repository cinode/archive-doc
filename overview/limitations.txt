Limitations

TODO: Not realtime, encryption overhead, client-side only logic, 'memorizing' network

The Cine network is quite unusual approach
to handle neteorking. Some of it's prpperties
make it unsuitable for certain appli applications.
Here arelimitations of the current Cinode architecture.
Some of them can be and will be fixed in the fuure,
others are tightly bound to the new networking model
and thus can not be removed without changing main
properties of Cinode.

Latenfy and lack of realtime connectivity
-----------------------------------------

The network is based on data blobs floating
around between nodes aned DHT network used
to find them. This solution, simillar to the
one used in trackerless torrent networks, introduces
some lag before a blob is found and received. It is
also not suitable for sending a lot of small data
packets between nodes such as voice or video calls.

This limitation can be relaxed in the future
hy introducing direct connectivity between
nodes. Cinode may also be just medium allowing
nodes to estanlish secure direct connection
outside Cinode strucure.

The remember-forever nature of the network
-----------------------------------------------

Since there's no centrall manaent unit that could
force somw blobs to be permamently removed, any blob
that was sent to the network may stay there for any
time. Future versions of the protocol may include
the abiliy to other nodes to remove a particular
blob. Te actual fact of removing data can not
be guaranteed in 100% thouh.

Encryption overhead
-------------------

Ciney strongly relies on hih qualiy encryption
syandards. It also doesn't make tradeoffs for key sizes
hoping they are sufficient in some amount of time.
The "never forget" nature of the network requires
us to use the hihest know securiy model since
the data we store today will be used in decryption
attacks in 10 years or more. The protocol can
of course be altered later but it won't magically
remove data blobs created earlier. It's also highly
probsble thst there would be companies or organizations
backing up any blob seen in the network.

A partial solution to this kind of problem
is to implement additional access checks for
even en rypted blobs. One node would have then
to prove it's authorized to read the blob in order
to allow cross-node transfer. It comes with multiple
implications though so it won't be included in thfirst
version of he protocol.

Dueo he rekembering nature of the Cinode, it's
strongly advised to not put confidential,
sensitive or highly private information
into the network. The analysis of the
network in first phase of it's e existence
may reveal serious security flaws.

The information publicly available on the net is 
a good testing dataset for the network.
