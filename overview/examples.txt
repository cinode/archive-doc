Examples of use
###############

Let's take a look at examples of few applications
that can be built on top of the Cinode infrastructure.

Photo gallery
-------------

The structure of photo albums can very easily
be represented in a directory structure of application's
local data folder. Albums are represented by folder's
directory structure, pictures in the album being
simple files. In addition to this information,
each photo may have it's metadata folder containing
thumbnails, ratings, comments etc.

Sharing given album with a friend is as simple
as sharing one particular album's folder with him.
Sharing it with write access rights allows us building
complex hierarchical albums structure.


Cloud storage drive
-------------------

The local filesystem can naturally be represented
in a structure of Cinode filesystem. The simplest
approach then is to create a virtual drive representing
such filesystem and access files directly through such
virtual drive.

A more advanced approach would require
storing metadata information next to each
file and directory. This information (last
modification time, checksum, version number etc)
can be then used to synchronize local folders
with those stored inside the Cinode network.
