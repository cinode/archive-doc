How it's built
##############

The smallest building block of Cinode is a Node. The Node itself is fully functional
and allow the user to use it's Local Access Interface. The Node itself is using
a permament storage like local hard drive to store iformation in form of data blobs.

Nodes can communicate between themselves using secure connections. Those communication
channels are needed to exchange blobs between Nodes. This data migration is used to 
create backups of data and to create local blob cache to be quickly accessible by the
user.

Every data blob is uniquely named using hash-based identifier. This allows a global
Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to be used in order to allow searching for a particular
blob.
