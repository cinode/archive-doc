<h2>1.1. What the Cinode is?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-the-cinode-is" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is a new kind of network used to host files and run web-like applications</li>
<li>It&#8217;s fully distributed system made of resources cumulatively shared by users of the network</li>
<li>The security and authorization is enforced by best known encryption algorithms</li>

</ul>

<div class="section" id="how-it-s-built">
<h2>1.2. How it&#8217;s built<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-s-built" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The smallest building block of the Cinode is a Node. The Node itself is fully functional
and allow the user to use it&#8217;s Local Access Interface. It is using a permanent storage
such as a local hard drive to store information. All data is organized in form of
data blobs.</p>
<p>Nodes can communicate between themselves using secure connections. Those communication
channels are needed to exchange blobs between Nodes. This data migration is used to
create backups of data and to create local blob cache that can be quickly accessed by the
user.</p>
<p>Every data blob is uniquely named using hash-based identifier. This allows a global
Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to be used in order to allow searching for a node holding
particular blob.</p>
<p>The Local interface available to the user is presented in a form
of a filesystem accessible through node&#8217;s built-in HTTP web proxy. Applications
hosted inside Cinode are also loaded from this filesystem. They
are executed locally on the user&#8217;s machine and have access to
a part of the filesystem being app&#8217;s execution environment.</p>
<p>In order to allow users to communicate through Cinode
applications, given filesystem directory or file
can be shared with another user. Such shared resource
can be then plugged into the filesystem of another user
becoming available for his own instance of the application.
Internally this share is realized by cresting cryptographic
connections betwen blobs resulting in moving blobs between nodes. This
process is fully automatic from the user&#8217;s point of view and
doesn&#8217;t need any extra activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-security">
<h2>1.3. The security<a class="headerlink" href="#the-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cinode was built with security in mind. The lack of server side forces us
to use alternative methods for user authorization. The approach that has
been used is based on cryptography.</p>
<p>Every blob in the Cinode network is stored and transferred to other nodes in an
encrypted form. The ability to decrypt this data (knowing the decryption key) equals
a read access.</p>
<p>In addition, each blob reveals extra cryptographic properties similar to
digital signatures. These properties are used
to validate blob and make sure that it&#8217;s content was created, modified
or simply accepted by an authorized user. Simply put, it&#8217;s equal to write access
authorization. The creator/modifier/acceptor of the blob must be in a
possession of all information needed to make the blob valid
such as a private key used to sign blob&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>The blob validation process does not require read access rights
(the data encryption key). By doing so, nodes can safely exchange
blobs between themselves without revealing the actual blob content.
This allows less trusted 3rd parties to offer services like
secure backups, load balancing and blob proxies without the need to
reveal the information used by their clients.</p>
<div class="section" id="selected-encryption-algorithms">
<h3>1.3.1. Selected encryption algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#selected-encryption-algorithms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Default hash - SHA-512</li>
<li>Default symmetric cipher - AES-256 in CFB chaining mode</li>
<li>Default asymmetric cipher - RSA using key of 4096 bits</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consideration-of-quantum-cryptography">
<h3>1.3.2. Consideration of quantum cryptography<a class="headerlink" href="#consideration-of-quantum-cryptography" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since algorithms applied in the Cinode may need to stand the test of time,
a quantum cryptography must be taken into account.
Currently known attacks on symmetric ciphers result in reduction of the
algorithm&#8217;s strengthens by factor of 2 so even if SHA-256 is cracked, it would
have the same strength as SHA-128 which is still fairly good.
The problem that still persists in the post-quantum era is the ability to break
widely used asymetric ciphers such as RSA.
For this reason, Cinode should consider using post-quantum
cryptography ciphers such as NTRU in order to prepare for the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="local-access-interface">
<h2>1.4. Local access interface<a class="headerlink" href="#local-access-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The user can access the Cinode by a web proxy server built into the
node software. It can be disabled creating a node that participates
in cross-blob traffic only,
a server-like node not accessible by standard user interface.</p>
<p>The HTTP proxy interface provides an easy to use web panel viewable
by any modern web browser. It also allows execution of client-side
web-based applications written in javascript, native client code or
similar technology. Files needed to execute such application are also hosted
on the Cinode network removing any dependency for external services.</p>
<p>All information hosted inside the Cinode network is stored inside data blobs.
They can form a structure similar to a filesystem due to a presence of
directory and link blobs. The actual structure is a bit more complex
than a directory tree and
is called blob graph, directed cyclic one from the algorithmic point of view.
User&#8217;s Cinode-hosted filesystem is a part of this graph
with one blob promoted to be an entry point to user&#8217;s root directory:</p>
<p class="graphviz">
<img src="../_images/graphviz-f22e4590ac30020354471e4b038f3dfddddd243d.png" alt="digraph BlobGraph {

        a1 -&gt; a2;
        a2 -&gt; a3;
        a3 -&gt; a4;
        a3 -&gt; a5;
        a2 -&gt; s1;

        b1 -&gt; b2;
        b2 -&gt; s1;
        b2 -&gt; b3;
        b2 -&gt; b4;


        s1 -&gt; s2;
        s2 -&gt; s3;
        s2 -&gt; s4;
        s2 -&gt; s5;

}" />
</p>
<p>In the example above, a1 and b1 are root blobs for separate users.
Each user see his own part of the graph and doesn&#8217;t see the part to
which he has no reference to. For example user of a1-based filesystem
doesn&#8217;t see blobs: b1, b2, b3 and b4. Similarly, the user of b1-based
filesystem doesn&#8217;t see blobs: a1, a2, a3, a4 and a5. The shared part
(s1, s2, s3 and s4) can be accessed by both users.</p>
<p>The filesystem can be easily accessed and manipulated through a simple
web API provided by the proxy. This is especially useful to Cinode-based
applications. Each one of them is executed in a safe sandbox by using
a randomized &#8220;virtual&#8221; hostname. In addition to that, this particular
hostname provides an access to a particular sub-directory in the user&#8217;s
filesystem blocking any access outside the sandbox. The randomized
hostname for every application and same-origin policy implemented in
all modern browsers prevents applications from accessing the information
they were not authorized to. It also hardens any sniffing attempts
by a malicious software installed locally on user&#8217;s computer.</p>
<p>Since the user&#8217;s password usually tends to be the weakest point in nowadays
application, Cinode does use cryptographic asymmetric keys instead. In order
to login, such key must be provided by the user. Similarly to how openSSH
keys are protected, the key may require an extra passphrase before it can
be used.</p>
<p>The master key and optional password screen is the first location the web proxy
shows to the user. After successful login, the user is presented a master
panel where he can view installed applications, browse for files, share nodes etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="limitations">
<h2>1.5. Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Cinode network is quite unusual approach
to handle cloud services. Some of it&#8217;s properties
make it unsuitable for certain types of applications.
There are known limitations of the current Cinode architecture.
Some of them can be and will be fixed in future versions,
others are tightly bound to the uncommon networking model and thus
can not be dealt with without changing root Cinode&#8217;s design decisions.</p>
<div class="section" id="latency-and-lack-of-realtime-connectivity">
<h3>1.5.1. Latency and lack of realtime connectivity<a class="headerlink" href="#latency-and-lack-of-realtime-connectivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The network is based on data blobs floating around
between nodes and DHT network used to look for them.
This solution, similar to the one used in trackerless
torrent networks, introduces significant lag between
the time a search is initiated and the time of final
blob&#8217;s arrival. It greatly reduces the ability to exchange
information between nodes where the delivery time
is critical, especially while dealing with a lot of small
data packets. To show an example, a low latency is needed in
realtime collaboration software that use video and voice chats.</p>
<p>This limitation can be relaxed in the future
by introducing direct connectivity between
nodes. Cinode may either be used to establish needed
realtime data channels or be just a negotiating medium
allowing nodes to establish secure direct connection
outside Cinode structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-always-remember-nature-of-the-network">
<h3>1.5.2. The always-remember nature of the network<a class="headerlink" href="#the-always-remember-nature-of-the-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no central management unit in Cinode that could
force some blobs to be permanently removed. Any blob
that was sent to the network may stay there for unspecified
amount of time. This introduces potential security threat
due to the fact that some ciphers may be cracked over time.</p>
<p>Future versions of the protocol may include the ability
to instruct other nodes to remove a particular blob.
But even if this method is implemented, the actual fact
of removing data can never be guaranteed in 100%.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sniffing-nodes">
<h3>1.5.3. Sniffing nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#sniffing-nodes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One form of malicious software existing in the network
will be a sniffing node. A base node&#8217;s functionality may be
extended to store as much information from the network
as possible, gathering information for statistical analysis
and for possible future cracking attempts.</p>
<p>Although current version does implement read access
authorization, it&#8217;s security relies on the unbreakability
of encryption algorithms applied there.</p>
<p>Due to the issue just presented, we highly encourage not to
put any confidential, personal or sensitive information
into the network during the current phase of it&#8217;s existence.
It&#8217;s highly probable that some security issues are still present
in the software. Instead, we propose to put publicly available
information to the network first to gain reasonable amount
of information used for testing purposes.</p>
<p>Future Cinode versions will implement ability to
restrict read access even more so that it&#8217;s impossible
to even download the encrypted content without proving
that read access rights have been granted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="encryption-overhead">
<h3>1.5.4. Encryption overhead<a class="headerlink" href="#encryption-overhead" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cinode design strongly relies on high quality encryption
standards. The tradeoff between encryption efficiency
and the security is an always-win for the security.
The &#8220;always-remember&#8221; nature of the network requires
us to use the highest know security model since
the data we store today may be used in future decryption
attacks. The increased key sizes and stronger algorithms
may result in increased need for computational power.</p>

<div class="section" id="examples-of-use">
<h2>1.6. Examples of use<a class="headerlink" href="#examples-of-use" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at examples of few applications
that can be built on top of the Cinode infrastructure.</p>
<div class="section" id="photo-gallery">
<h3>1.6.1. Photo gallery<a class="headerlink" href="#photo-gallery" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The structure of photo albums can very easily
be represented in a directory structure of application&#8217;s
local data folder. Albums are represented by folder&#8217;s
directory structure, pictures in the album being
simple files. In addition to this information,
each photo may have it&#8217;s metadata folder containing
thumbnails, ratings, comments etc.</p>
<p>Sharing given album with a friend is as simple
as sharing one particular album&#8217;s folder with him.
Sharing it with write access rights allows us building
complex hierarchical albums structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cloud-storage-drive">
<h3>1.6.2. Cloud storage drive<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-storage-drive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The local filesystem can naturally be represented
in a structure of Cinode filesystem. The simplest
approach then is to create a virtual drive representing
such filesystem and access files directly through such
virtual drive.</p>
<p>A more advanced approach would require
storing metadata information next to each
file and directory. This information (last
modification time, checksum, version number etc)
can be then used to synchronize local folders
with those stored inside the Cinode network.</p>
