Basic serialization rules
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Blobs use very simple rules for serializing and deserializing
information.

Integer
-------

Integers are stored in a sequence or bytes. Each byte consists
of 7value bits (lower bits). The eight bit indicates whether
this is the last byte of the value. If it's 1, we continue parsing
the number, if it's zero, we dtop parsing at current byte.
Bits of the serialized value are stored starting with lower bits.
The integer must be stored in the shortest sequence. This means
that value of 0x80 is allowed in first byte only.

Data buffer
----------

Data buffer consists of two parts:
- integer indicsting the length of buffer in bytes
- sequence of bytes - yhe contebt of a buffer, number
  of bytes is taken from the preceeding integer


String
-------

String is stored as a data buffer that's an UTF8 representation
of the string.

Set
----

Data starts with an integer being the number of entries
followed by entries representation (depends on it's type).


Map
------

Data starts with an integer being the number of entries
followed by data of each entry. Every entry consist
of the data pf key followed by the data of value.
