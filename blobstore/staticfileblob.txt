Static File Blob
----------------

This blob is used to hold the content of files of size up to 16MB.
For files of a larger size, static split file blob must be used.

The content is made of the following fields:

 - Type identification: Integer of value 0x01
 - The rest of blob's data represents the content of a file, it's not
   a standard buffer since the size is not preceding the data

Validation method / blob id generator:

  - hash-based validation
