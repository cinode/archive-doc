Static Split Directory Blob
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This blob can be used to represent directories
with a number of entries greater or equal to 1024
by distributing them over multiple separate blobs.
The number of sub-blobs ( SubCount ) that will be used is calculated
using the following formula:

.. math::

  SubCount = \left\lceil\frac{EntriesCount}{1024}\right\rceil

In order to distribute entries between blobs, following methods
can be used:

- splitting sorted array (numeric id of method: 0x01)
	In this method the list of entries sorted by entry name is
	uniformly split into SubCount parts. The assignment of Nth entry
	(indexing from 0) to a blob of id BNum (indexing from 0) is as follows:
	
	.. math::
	
		BNum = \left\lfloor\frac{N*SubCount}{EntriesCount}\right\rfloor
		
	This method should be used when there's a need to scan entry ranges
	(i.e. list all entries with names between 'alice' and 'bob') but may
	theoretically reveal some information whiles analyzing changes of
	sub blobs

- distribute using hash function similarly to bucket in the hash table (numeric id of method: 0x02)
	In this method, a hash of the entry name is used to find the 
	desired blob number. The hash is calculated as first four bytes
	of the SHA-256 function applied on UTF-8 encoded file name.
	The assignment of blob with name N to a subblob of id Bnum is done
	as follows:
	
	.. math::
	
		BNum = \left\lfloor\frac{hash(name)*SubCount}{2^{32}}\right\rfloor
		
	This method gives much greater cryptographic security since adding names topologically
	close to themselves may result in distant sub-blobs. It's the preferred method.  

The content of the file consists of following fields:

 - Type identification: Integer of value 0x12
 - Total number of entries: Integer
 - Numeric id of distribution method
 - Array with a list of blobs containing entry groups,
   when concatenated sequentially they form content of the file.
   Each array entry consists of following fields:

   - BID: String, The blob must be of type: Static File Blob (0x01)
   - Data KEY: String
