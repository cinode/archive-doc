Static Split Directory Blob
---------------------------

This blob can be used to represent directories
with a number of entries greater than 1024
by distributing them over multiple separate blobs.
The number of sub-blobs - *SubCount* that will be used,
is calculated using the following formula:

.. math::

  SubCount = \left\lceil\frac{EntriesCount}{1024}\right\rceil

In order to distribute entries between blobs, following methods
can be used:

- Sorted-Ranges (numeric id of method: 0x01)

  In this method the list of entries sorted by entry name (UTF-8 case sensitive binary sort)
  is uniformly split into SubCount parts. The assignment of *Nth* entry to a blob of id *BNum*
  is as follows:
  
  .. math::
	
		BNum = \left\lfloor\frac{N*SubCount}{EntriesCount}\right\rfloor
		
  *N* must be in range ( 0 .. *EntriesCount* -1 ) inclusively,
  *BNum* must be in range ( 0 .. *SubCount* -1 ) inclusively

  This method should be used when there's a need to scan entry ranges
  (i.e. list all entries with names between 'alice' and 'bob'). It should
  be used carefully though since it may reveal some information during
  sub-blob analysis.

- Hash-Distribution (numeric id of method: 0x02)

  In this method, a hash of the entry name is used to find the 
  desired blob number. The hash is calculated as first four bytes
  of the SHA-256 function applied on UTF-8 encoded file name.
  The assignment of blob with name *N* to a sub-blob of id *BMum* is done
  as follows:
  
  .. math::
	
		BNum = \left\lfloor\frac{hash(name)*SubCount}{2^{32}}\right\rfloor

  This method gives much greater cryptographic security since adding names topologically
  close to themselves may result in distant sub-blobs.

  This method is preferred and should be used if otherwise not specified.

The content of the blob consists of the following fields:

 - Type identification: Integer of value 0x12
 - Total number of entries: Integer
 - Numeric id of distribution method: Integer of value 0x01 for Sorted-Ranges, 0x02 for Hash-Distribution
 - Array with a list of blobs containing entry groups. When all entries from all sub-groups are merged
   together, they form full list of entries in the directory stored in this blob. Each array entry consists
   of following fields:

   - BID: String, Id of the sub-blob, it must be of type: Static Directory Blob (0x11)
   - Data KEY: String, Key for sub-blob's data
