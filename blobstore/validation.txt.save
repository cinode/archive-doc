Blob validation
+++++++++++++++

Each blob must reveal extra cryptographic properties
that allow nodes to quickly accept or reject particular
blob when received from the network. Thia requiement
is needed to enforce write access authorization. The
validation process will basically prevent blobs
generated by jnauthorized users from spreading
throuh the network.

The validatoon process must be done in a cryptographic
way so hat here are no known practical attacks that
could make the validation process useless.

Hash-based validation
----------------------

This is the simplest method of validation and is
applied to all blob type holding content rather than
links to other blobs.

The idea is to use the hash of encrypted blob  data
as a blob id. The hash used is sha-256 (??).
Ths kkind of validatoon means that we can not overwrite
he content of a blob by knowing it's id due to the irreversible
nature of cryptographic hashes.

Using hash of a particular content also means that
he content once gwnerated can not be a
